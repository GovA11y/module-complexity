# JavaScript Elements

1. **Use of Dynamic Content**
   This variable assesses the extent to which a page employs dynamic content, such as JavaScript and AJAX calls.

    - **Calculation:** Analyze the presence and complexity of JavaScript code and dynamic content loading mechanisms.
    - **Importance:** Pages relying heavily on dynamic content tend to introduce additional accessibility challenges, contributing to their complexity.
    - **Defined Variable:** `dynamicContentUsed`

2. **Script Complexity**
   This variable measures the complexity of JavaScript code used on the page.

    - **Calculation:** Count the number of `<script>` tags and external JavaScript files referenced in the page.
    - **Importance:** A large number of scripts can suggest higher interactivity and dynamic content, contributing to the page's complexity.
    - **Defined Variable:** `scriptComplexity`

3. **Number of Event Listeners**
    This variable counts the total number of event listeners on the page.

    - **Calculation:** Traverse the DOM and count the number of attached JavaScript event listeners.
    - **Importance:** A high number of event listeners can indicate high interactivity and complexity.
    - **Defined Variable:** `eventListenersCount`

4. **Number of AJAX Calls**
   This variable assesses the number of AJAX calls made by the page.

    - **Calculation:** Monitor the network activity and count the number of AJAX calls.
    - **Importance:** Numerous AJAX calls can indicate a more dynamic and complex page.
    - **Defined Variable:** `ajaxCallsCount`

5. **Number of Web Sockets**
    This variable measures the number of active WebSockets on the page.

    - **Calculation:** Monitor the network activity and count the number of WebSocket connections.
    - **Importance:** Use of WebSockets can indicate a high level of real-time interactivity and complexity.
    - **Defined Variable:** `webSocketsCount`

6. **Number of Timeout/Interval Functions**
    This variable counts the number of `setTimeout` and `setInterval` calls in the page's scripts.

    - **Calculation:** Parse JavaScript code to count the instances of these timing functions.
    - **Importance:** Extensive use of these functions can increase the dynamism and complexity of a page.
    - **Defined Variable:** `timeoutIntervalFunctionsCount`
